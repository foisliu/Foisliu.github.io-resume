            During my second year of college, a group of classmates and I organized an event called the astrophysics party within the astronomy club. The main objective of this activity was to support students interested in academic research in astronomy by providing them with a better understanding of the field and fostering collective progress on their scientific journey.
        </p>
            Every Sunday evening, we would gather in the club's meeting room where one student would present one or two chapters from Prof. Shouping Xiang's Astrophysics book. This presentation was followed by a discussion where other students could ask questions and engage in conversation. Additionally, we would explore recently published astronomical papers that caught our interest on arXiv, sharing our insights and experiences at the party while exchanging ideas with fellow students. For those who were interested in pursuing external opportunities for astronomical research, we made efforts to assist them in finding suitable mentors. Recently, we have also invited senior students who pursued graduate studies in astronomy to return to their alma mater and share their own research experiences with us undergraduate students, offering valuable advice and assistance.

            But most importantly, our astrophysics party is not serious at all! In fact, the weekly gatherings are incredibly enjoyable, and everyone eagerly shares their insights. Moreover, we also offer potato chips, cola, and fried chicken at the party (some even consider it their dinner for the day). Let's have a toast!
