            When I joined the astronomy club during my freshman year at university, I initially became a member of the popular science group within the club called '物观星移' (Wu Guan Xing Yi). Our main responsibility was to develop teaching plans and gather teaching materials. We started by delivering trial lectures within the club, where fellow students would assist us in identifying errors and offering suggestions for improvement. Once we refined our course content, we eagerly volunteered to deliver popular science lectures on astronomy at primary schools in Jinan City.

            The primary school where I gave a lecture was Hongjialou Primary School. The topic of my presentation was the formation and evolution of stars, which included fascinating processes like T Tauri stars and the Lin-Shu process. To help the children grasp the concept of star sizes more easily, I also used Universe Sandbox software for visual simulations. My goal was to ensure that everyone could understand and appreciate the subject matter.

            Initially, I felt quite nervous as I stepped onto the stage, unsure if the students would find this content engaging. However, their enthusiasm quickly dispelled any doubts I had. When discussing how supermassive stars undergo supernova explosions in their late stages of evolution and may form black holes, the children's excitement reached its peak. They eagerly engaged in discussions about supernovae and black holes with me.

            Through my involvement in science popularization groups, I have come to realize how crucial it is to promote astronomy outreach to the public. As an avid astronomy enthusiast myself, I strongly believe in conveying intriguing astronomical knowledge to society at large - preserving that sense of wonderment in children's eyes while allowing more people to appreciate the beauty of astronomy.
